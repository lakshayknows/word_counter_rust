A simple command-line tool written in **Rust** that reads a line of text from the user and counts the number of words.  
Built as a practice project while learning **ownership**, **borrowing**, and **I/O handling** in Rust.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Reads user input from the terminal  
- Counts words using Rust’s iterator methods  
- Demonstrates clean code and safe memory handling  
- Beginner-friendly and fully functional  

---

## 🧩 Example

```bash
$ cargo run
Please input your string.
> hello world from rust
Your word count was: 4
```

* How to use `&str` and `String` correctly  
* How to handle user input using `std::io`
